Raleigh is the capital of the state of North Carolina as well as the seat of Wake County in the United States. 
Raleigh is known as the "City of Oaks" for its many oak trees, which line the streets in the heart of the city.

The dataset of my hometown Thalassery, Kerala, India was very small(less than 50 MB). So, I decided to take a place which 
I have visited with my family. I choose Raleigh, North Carolina, since I went there during my last vacation and was there 
for over a month. I am still familiar with the places in Raleigh, so I thought it would be interesting to work with this 
dataset.

PS: in order to upload the sample osm file I had to change the code slightly. My osm file is slightly less than 500 MB. 
Using the given code I could shrink to only around 50 MB. Since the requirement was 1-10 MB I had to slightly modify it. 
I changed it to:

for i, element in enumerate(get_element(OSM_FILE)):
        if i % 50 == 0:
            output.write(ET.tostring(element, encoding='utf-8'))

    output.write('</osm>')
